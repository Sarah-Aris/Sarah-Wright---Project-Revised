<p> <h3> <span>  I can multitask </span> </h3> <p>


I love working on a variety of projects at the same time and I do my best work against the clock. I thrive (and succeed) on a deadline, which probably explains my love of and commitment to espresso.


<p> <h3> <span> Writing skills are important too </span> </h3> </p>


Words matter. What separates a great writer from a good writer is the ability to make sense of the world for readers; providing content in simple, not simplistic terms; delivering what they want in a way that connects them to the story. Working for a variety of publications, both online and print, I am proud to say, has allowed me to hone my writing skills and to build my credibility in the business.



<p> <h3> <span> The devil is in the details </span> </h3> </p>

Project management and organizational abilities are essential when it comes to executing against communications strategies, fact checking and researching articles.  I take great pride in having developed and consistently applying these skills.  No task is too small; you will rarely see me without my moleskin agenda.
